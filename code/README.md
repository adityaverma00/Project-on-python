# INTRODUCTION
This is a repository to show case my learning so far and the concepts I have learnt till now in Python
## Research and Learning
Till now i have learnt various function in Python
- if and else 
- class
- fucntions
- attributes
- turtle
- if and elif
- def
and many more
### while doing this project i learnt to use turtle and make a snake game, i learnt about turtle and how it can be beneficial for me to make a drawing board and i can just draw anything over it. Moreover, i tried to learn tkinter but it was quite complex and i didnt quite understand it, but right now i am trying to learn it and i will try to implement it in the future

### Apart from that, doing this project made me learn if and elif conditon more precisely and even in the ticket system i made i learnt over there as well.

### I have also attacthed a png to show my planning while making the snake game

## My experienece 
It was a great experience , i learnt various things how to use classes and def more accurately and i tried to know what is actually happening and why is it happening. In all, Python is Fun as it requires a lot of logic.

## Additional info
i have tried making another projects like a calculator using html, java and css which is shown in a different repostory

## Thank you
